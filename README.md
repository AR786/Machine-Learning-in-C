# Machine-Learning-in-C
The following project provides five machine learning algorithms implemented using C language as a library
Algorithms implemented are:
linear regression, K-means clustering, mean shift clustering, K-nearest neighbours, DBSCAN
all the algorithms are represnted as a library in C
Also some effort has been made to present the points on a simple graph(not accurate though). Values otherwise are accurate
